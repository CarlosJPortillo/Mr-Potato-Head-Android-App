# Mr-Potato-Head-Android-App
Simple small silly app, where you can construct and put the pieces of a Mr. Potato Head. The parts shown are dictated by checkboxes. Note this idea was not mine, this was an actual assignment for a university course(not one I had), but I figured it would be good practice for me and it looked fun to do. The app was coded by me.
